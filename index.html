<h1>Hello there! I'm Jairus Adriel T. Garcia</h1>
<p>Just an aspiring poet learning code.</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I'm currently studying at STI, I'm learning programming Java and HTML languages in section MAWD-102.</p>

<h2>My Hobbies</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Gaming</li>
</ul>
<p>
  I enjoy spending my free time playing games, whether it's competitive first person shooters, simulators, or strategy games. Gaming helps me relax, improve my reflexes, and even sharpen my problem solving skills.  
  With late night playing sessions of minecraft grinding with friends, gaming has always been my go-to escape from reality.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Poetry</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Although I'm still inexperienced when it comes to writing poetry, I still enjoy doing it as a side hobby when I have nothing else to do, although I mainly only write my poems digitalized and not traditionally. Most of the time the themes of my poems are about love, although I'm planning to explore other themes to write about soon, I have some of my poems posted on my Instagram.
</p>
